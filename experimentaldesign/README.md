| 15:1  | 15%               | 1%                  |

## Procedure

### üîπ Preparing PVA Stock Solutions

#### 10 wt% PVA Solution (100 g total)
- Weigh 10.0 g of PVA powder.
- Weigh 90.0 g of deionized water.
- Pour some water into a beaker and place on heat/stir plate (~70¬∞C).
- Soak PVA powder in cold water first, then add to heated beaker.
- Pour remaining water into the beaker.
- Stir gently for 30‚Äì60 minutes until cloudiness disappears.
- Let cool to room temperature and seal.

#### 15 wt% PVA Solution (100 g total)
- Weigh 15.0 g of PVA powder.
- Weigh 85.0 g of deionized water.
- Repeat heating and mixing steps as with 10% solution.

### üîπ Preparing Borax Stock Solutions

#### 0.5 wt% Borax Solution (100 g total)
- Weigh 0.50 g of Borax powder.
- Weigh 99.5 g of deionized water.
- Warm water, then pour some into a beaker and begin stirring.
- Add Borax powder and remaining water.

#### 1 wt% Borax Solution (100 g total)
- Weigh 1.00 g of Borax powder.
- Weigh 99.0 g of deionized water.
- Repeat mixing steps as with 0.5% solution.

### üîπ Creating Crosslinked Hydrogel (Multiple Trials)

**Trial Ratios**:
- 20:1 (10% PVA + 0.5% Borax)
- 30:1 (15% PVA + 0.5% Borax)
- 10:1 (10% PVA + 1% Borax)
- 15:1 (15% PVA + 1% Borax)

**Steps**:
1. Measure stock solutions according to selected ratios.
2. Pour Borax solution directly into PVA solution.
3. Stir vigorously for 1‚Äì2 minutes (gelation is rapid).
4. Record observations and determine optimal concentration balance (use a rheometer if available).
