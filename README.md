# Hydrogel Printer
3D Hydrogel Printer for the Hackclub Undercity contest. Hydrogel uses a Polyvinyl Alcohol based hydrogel using a Co based aqueous battery as an inner fluid. A PVA hydrogel is formed by cross-linking the PVA solution into a gel network by adding a borax solution. The method of printing is a screw extrusion based printer. It is built off a Ender 3's core.
# PCB
The biggest issue during extrusion is lack of control of the material flow, our PCB uses flow sensors in order to send data back to the computer so that it can optimize the nozzle's speed in order to control the overall print
